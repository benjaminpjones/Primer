*__Exercise 1.6__: Explain whether the following problem fragment is legal.*

```cpp
std::cout << "The sum of " << v1;
          << " and " << v2;
          << " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;
```
*If you think the program is legal, what does it do? If the program is not legal, why not? How would you fix it?*

The program fragment is not legal because the << operators on the second and third lines do not have an operand on which to output.  I would fix this error by removing the semicolons at the end of lines 1 and 2 in order to make this code fragment a continuous statement.
