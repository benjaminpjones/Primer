// Exercise 1.2: Change the program to return -1. A return value of -1 is often 
// treated as an indicator that the program failed. Recompile and rerun your
// program to see how your system treats a failure indicator from main.

int main()
{
    return -1;
}

// Using g++ on a Mac, there does not seem to be any indicator that the program
// failed after running it in the Terminal.
